## Overview

This repository provides sample code for a [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/) Web API that uses [Console Access Library for Python](https://github.com/SonySemiconductorSolutions/aitrios-sdk-console-access-lib-python) to respond inference results to a [frontend application (aitrios-sample-application-check-data-tool-ts)](https://github.com/SonySemiconductorSolutions/aitrios-sample-application-check-data-tool-ts), as well as configuration files for building a development environment. This application builds an API to retrieve and return object detection based metadata from Console.

## Get Started

### Build an environment and get started with the sample application

1. Clone or fork this application in your GitHub environment.
2. Click the `+` button to create a codespace on the GitHub environment. See [how to create a codespace](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-for-a-repository).
3. Create console access setting configuration file with real values under [src/data_loader/common/config/](./src/data_loader/common/console_access_settings.yaml.sample).
    `src/data_loader/common/console_access_settings.yaml`

    ```yaml
    console_access_settings:
        console_endpoint: "__console_endpoint__"
        portal_authorization_endpoint: "__portal_authorization_endpoint__"
        client_secret: "__client_secret__"
        client_id: "__client_id__"
    ```

    > **Note**
    > - Specify the base URL
    > - Specify the token URL
    > - Specify registered application secret for client_secret
    > - Specify registered application client ID for client_id

    See the [Portal user manual](https://developer.aitrios.sony-semicon.com/en/edge-ai-sensing/documents/portal-user-manual/) for details.
4. Run the sample application using the following command.

    ```sh
    $ cd ./src
    $ flask run --debugger --reload
    ```

5. Open `localhost:5000` in a browser and verify that the application is running.

    > **Note**
    > Please check only for codespaces users!
    >
    > **Public Ports (Front-end application link)**  
    > To link with the front-end application, follow the steps below to make the port on codespaces public.
    > 1. Open a terminal and open the [Port] tab. Right-click on the port that will be shared and, after clicking on [Port Display Range], click on [Public].
    > 2. Click on the copy icon on the right side of the portâ€™s local adress and copy it.
